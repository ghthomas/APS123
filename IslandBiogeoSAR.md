Can we make any predictions about where we would expect to find the most species?

### Aims

- To justify interest in island ecosystems
- To derive & discuss core predictions of island biogeography theory
- To understand how the theory has been applied in conservation

* * * 

### Today

- Patterns in island biogeography
- The Species Area Relationship (SAR)
- Predicting extinction from the SAR

Ecologists have physics envy
